        <li>Since hip hop broke into his life, somewhere in the 1980s, Guts has devoted it all his time and energy.
        <li>From that passion is born “Hip Hop After All” in 2014.
        <li>In 2019, it was initially the idea of a return to his basics of beatmaker which had settled in the spirit of Guts
        <li>After this return to beatmaking, Guts finally put out another, PHILANTROPIQUES, on March 29th
